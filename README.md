# JLOX

A Java Interpreter for the Lox language, following the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

### Notes:
- Learnt the visitor pattern through this interpreter which was super cool.

### Extensions:
- I've made it a runtime error to access a variable that has not been initialised.

### Things to add:
- need to refactor this into a Java project so that I can more easily compile and run the whole interpreter.
